Is Node JS Multi Thread ?
 In node there is one main thread...where runs v8engine or js code
 
 Libuv mainly hadle two type I/O - File System, Network Operation. Any Time an async function call from js
 it put to the event loops


Some Task that related to Network, it goes to the os while other task , like reading a file it goes to the thread pool

Thread Pool - There are some collection of thread in libuv.It is like thread present in processor.
it handle one work at a time

** All async code dont run in thread pool. Instead where possiable libuv use os karenl directly

--------------------Event Loop--------------------

Event Loop is responsialbe for all callback function in node programs. It alows Multi pale things in one at a time

When start some program executing in node runtime , a pice of code start running, this code is loop inside of libuv, this is event loop
