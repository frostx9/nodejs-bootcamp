Is Node JS Multi Thread ?
 In node there is one main thread...where runs v8engine or js code
 
 Libuv mainly hadle two type I/O - File System, Network Operation. Any Time an async function call from js
 it put to the event loops


Some Task that related to Network, it goes to the os while other task , like reading a file it goes to the thread pool

Thread Pool - There are some collection of thread in libuv.It is like thread present in processor.
it handle one work at a time

** All async code dont run in thread pool. Instead where possiable libuv use os karenl directly

--------------------Event Loop--------------------

Event Loop is responsialbe for all callback function in node programs. It alows Multi pale things in one at a time

When start some program executing in node runtime , a pice of code start running, this code is loop inside of libuv, this is event loop

Call back Qeue => Fist in First Out

Phase Of The Event Loop --------------

When a callback into a function like setTimeOut, when timer is complete is put to the qeue or callback qeue or event qeue to be executing a later time

There is no one callback qeue , we do qeue of callbacks that keep track of which tasks need to be run but in deep there is several deferent queues. Each one handle deforent phase of the
event loops

There is Event Loop Phase which is responsialbe for different types of operation
four man phase - 1. Timers, 2. I/O callback, 3. setImmeduiate, 4. Close callback

like A callback for set timeout would go on the timer queue. While a callback for a filesystem operation go to the I/O callback qeue. It alse know as pool qeue

There is 3 type timer -> 1. setTimeOut, 2.setInterVal, 3.setImmeduiate
