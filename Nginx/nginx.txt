NGINX :- 
  NGINX is a powerful web server and uses a non-threaded, even-driven architecture
It can also do other important things such as load balancing , HTTP caching or be used as reverse proxy


Until Now
                        Normal Http Conection
          Client -------------------------------------> Server

For Normal we use Normal Http Conection to connect the server with client. 


In VPN case (Proxy Server)

        Client ------------------> VPN -------------------> Server

In VPN connection when Multiaple client use vpn to connect the server vpn forward the request to the server on be half of clients.
This Techinque is called  ( Forward proxy )

** In here Server can not understand who is actual client , because in middle vpn act as a client , but not real client



[//] Reverse Proxy - In this Techinque We have Multiaple Server but cleint one

** In here client can not understand who is actual server, because in middle vpn  act as a server , he can decided the which server can handle the upcoming request


Most Popular that middle server is Nginx. We dont comunicate with main server directly. Nginx decide which server can handle the upcoming request

[//] Load balancing - Distributet all request to every server maintainly , so one server have too much load , others haven'that

[//] HTTP Cache - Supose userA request a image from server. Nginx take the request , pass the server. Got the response from server, pass the user.
                  Now userB request same image from server. Nginx make a cache of taht file when userA request taht same file. So any one request 
                  same file , he can pass the data. Wont need to call server again. So userB get that picture from NGINX server


** Example Config ( Not Real)

          {
            /admin : use Server 1
            / settings : use Server 2
            /hone : use Server 3
          }
